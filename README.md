# Personal Progress Tracker

Simple personal progress tracker — a small project to track tasks and progress.

## Overview

- This repository contains a lightweight tracker with an `index11.html` file as the main UI.
- Purpose: record progress, experiment with small UI features, and keep a personal log.

## Files

- `index11.html` — main HTML file for the tracker.

## Usage

1. Open `index11.html` in your browser (double-click or serve with a local web server).

Optional: run a simple static server from the project folder (Python required):

```
Push-Location 'd:\_codes\vibe coding\personal tracker'; python -m http.server 8000; Pop-Location
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/index11.html`.

## Git / Contribution

- This README was added to document the project. If you want me to expand it (features, screenshots, license), tell me what to include.

## Notes about pushing

- The push step may require that a Git remote (like `origin`) is configured and that you have permissions (SSH key or credential helper). If `git push` fails, run:

```
Push-Location 'd:\_codes\vibe coding\personal tracker'; git remote -v; git branch --show-current; Pop-Location
```

and share the output so I can help set the remote or push the branch.
